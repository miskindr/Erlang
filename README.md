# Overview
In this program I go over the Erlang language and show some basic examples of what the language can do. The purpose of this program was to show how I can pick up a programming language in a relitivly fast pace and be able to understand it.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
